# The-ButterflyðŸ¦‹
The butterfly is a game/simulation model that is based on the Butterfly effect on human decision making modelled as ANN, The project is inspired by the likes of Life is Strange Series
, Until Dawn and is a going to have a DnD styled interface.
This repository consists of progress made in desiging the simulation model that would serve as an backend to the game

Current Progress includes:

Creation of the ANN models
